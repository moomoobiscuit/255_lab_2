# 255 lab 2 (optimising classification trees)

My submission for the second DA lab for ENGSCI255. It involves creating classification trees to determine whether or not an 
email is spam or not, given the attributes of the emails. Techniques used: Loss Matrices to solve the bi-objective optimisation
problem of maximising sensitivity and sepificity of a prediction, varying tree depth to see optimal depth to use, creating random
forests of classification trees to further maximise performance, and creating a binary linear program in Excel to attain optimal
performance in a realistic scanning time. 

The submission can be viewed on the "ENGSCI 255 Lab 2" pdf file on GitHub.
